**Schedule at a glance**:



The main conference venue will be the [Biology Building](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Biology+Building/@39.1648848,-86.5395362,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x886c673b0cd6a7f1:0x188e43d018fc899c!8m2!3d39.1648863!4d-86.5210822!16s%2Fg%2F11pzztjw4x?entry=ttu) (1001 E. 3rd St.). Because of construction, the easiest way to enter is via the main entrance on 3rd St. Talks will be held in room 124, with posters and coffee breaks held in the atrium.

The easiest place to park if you're driving to campus is the [Atwater Parking Garage](https://www.google.com/maps/search/atwater+Parking+Garage/@39.1677561,-86.5311063,16z/data=!3m1!4b1?entry=ttu). Note that you must pay to park here if you leave before 6 pm on Friday--the gate goes up at 6 pm (it is free on weekends). The streets around campus require local permits, so please don't park there on Friday (no permits needed on weekends).

There is a great line-up of talks planned. Please see [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1spLdFTdgq48Zm6xpuhjHO0J6CTotknghVwTgCdLhoLc/edit) for the current schedule.

Since the talks begin at 12:20, please hang your posters before then. The poster boards are 4'x4', so should fit any size poster.

**If you're sick and can't make it, please let us know. No problem at all--we just need to know so we can try to rearrange the schedule.
